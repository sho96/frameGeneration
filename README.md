# frameGeneration
it does the frame generation using opencv's optical flow farneback function. (takes lower fps video as an input and outputs a higher fps video)
It's pretty computationary heavy to run.
There are cpu and gpu version of the code and gpu one is slightly faster than the cpu one (both does the same thing).
